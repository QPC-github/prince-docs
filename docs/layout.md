Layout is the way in which text and pictures are set out on a page. It defines the final look of a document. Prince understands layout by means of CSS, cascading style sheets.

In the following chapters we shall go through the main points when preparing the layout of a page. It mainly follows the general steps of layout for web pages: starting from [Text formatting](text-formatting.html#text-formatting) and [Paragraph formatting](text-formatting.html#paragraph-formatting), via the [Box Model](css-box.html#css-box), until [Tables](tables.html#tables), [Lists](lists.html#lists), [Columns](columns.html#columns), [Floats](floats.html#floats), [Flex Layout](flexbox.html#flexbox), and [Footnotes](footnotes.html#footnotes).

A separate chapter, [Paged Media](paged.html#paged), will analyze in-depth the major difference between formatting for the web and PDF/Print, namely that PDF is paginated, content is placed on discrete pages.
