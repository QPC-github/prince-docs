Styling
=======

When preparing a document with HTML and CSS, you need to first create the content - but then you need to style it to make it visually appealing. You can choose which fonts to use, how to format your text and your paragraphs, choose the layout for your page, give your text, background and style some color, insert images - and much more!

In the following sections you can find detailed information on how to achieve this with Prince.

The major difference between formatting for the web and PDF/Print is that PDF is [paginated](doc-latest/paged.html#paged), which means that content is placed on discrete pages, as opposed to one continuous flow, typical for web pages.

Prince allows you to control a number of options that affect how PDF formats pages, from straight-forward options such as page size, to decorations, headers and footers, numbering and page breaking options. See detailed information in the [Paged Media](doc-latest/paged.html#paged) section.

Prince applies default styles to all (X)HTML documents - these style rules can be found in the `html.css` style sheet, located in the `style` folder inside the installation directory (see [Installation Layout](doc-latest/installation-layout.html#installation-layout)).
