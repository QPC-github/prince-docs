### The Java Wrapper

Prince can be called from within a Java class for servlets by using [Java interface](wrappers.md#wrapper-java).

This package contains:

-   A single JAR file (`prince.jar`),
-   the [API documentation](wrappers/java/doc/index.md) and
-   the Java source code for reference.

The `Prince.jar` file contains the class file that provides the Java interface to Prince (`com.princexml.Prince`). The documentation lists the Java class methods and explains how to use them.
