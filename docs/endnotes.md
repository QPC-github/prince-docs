Endnotes are quite easy as their placement is not relative to the page. There are two ways of creating them.

In their most simple form, an endnote is placed at the end of the document by the author, with a (hyperlinked) call in the text.

However, it can be laborious to manually synchronize references in this manner. A more convenient alternative is to keep the notes inline and to move them to the end of the document at the time of formatting. This is a simple tree transformation which can be performed by a script. The following sample document features references which are kept inline and moved to the end by a script:

-   [HTML document](http://css4.pub/2015/usenix/example.html)
-   [PDF document](http://css4.pub/2015/usenix/example.pdf)

No special CSS formatting is required to support endnotes.

In a similar fashion table notes can be created. These are a variation of endnotes. However, instead of moving the notes to the end of the document, the notes are moved to the end of the table, or to the end of the table cell. Again, this is a simple tree transformation which doesn't require anything special from CSS.

The table in the above document sample also has inline notes that are moved to the end of the table by a script.
