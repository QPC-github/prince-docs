### The PHP5 Wrapper

Prince can be called from PHP using the [PHP interface](wrappers.md#wrapper-php5).

This package contains two files:

-   The `prince.php` script and
-   the [API documentation](wrappers/php5/readme.html).

The `prince.php` file contains the PHP class that provides the interface to Prince. The `readme.html` file lists the PHP class methods and explains how to use them.
