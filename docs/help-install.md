The Prince Installation Guide tries to be exhaustive in explaining how to install the application. However, there might always be something not answered in the documentation, or something not working as expected. There are a couple of ways to get help to solve the problems:

-   The section addresses possible common issues after installing and starting to use Prince;
-   The section provides answers to the most frequently asked questions about installation;
-   The [forum](//www.princexml.com/forum/) is an excellent place where to find an answer to an issue, or where to ask for help;
-   You can [contact us](//www.princexml.com/contact/) for support.
